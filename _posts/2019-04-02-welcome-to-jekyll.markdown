## How far should people be able to go in their search for justice?

For most of us, we often have experienced a situation where we felt that our rights are being undermined. For most of our history, people have fought, whether violent or not, for what they believe is fair. Today, we have many systems to ensure that our universal human rights are respected, though they may be flawed. We also allow people to come together as a group to defend their values. Yet, even today, there are parts of the world where tens of thousands of people are still treated with contempt and hostility; this regularly leads to conflict that can escalate rapidly. This begs the question: How far should we be allowed to go in our search for justice? 

At the heart of many conflicts, there are underlying elements that allow for a situation to escalate. First, there is usually a history of tension between a group and society. Secondly, there is a spark, an event that pushes a group (usually the oppressed) to act up against these norms. This occurred time and time again throughout history, we have the _French Revolution_ rose from the civil unrest among the poor; there was the _American Revolution _caused by the heavy taxation and a lack of representation for the colonies. 

 

A more prominent example, the _Oka Crisis_ was a conflict between the _Mohawk First Nations_ group and the Canadian Government over land rights of the _Kanesatake_ reserve. Long before the events of the Oka Crisis, the Canadian government took parts of the Kanesatake reserve, usually without the consent of the Mohawks. Many of these land claim issues were either “ignored or dismissed”. Then “in 1970, a militant group [formed] in Kanesatake reserve called the Mohawk Warriors”. With their goal of reclaiming the land that they believe should have been theirs, they built a barricade to delay the construction of luxury condos and even a golf course expansion plan. 

Here’s the audio from a news interview that helps summarize the Oka crisis. I’ve also included the transcript.

<i>News Reporter:</i> I’m Mr. Steve and this is Oka News, with new developments involving the conflict between the Mohawks and the government over land development on disputed Mohawk land. Here with us now is a special guest, who will help explain the situation.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Special Guest:</i> Thank you for having me. This conflict may seem somewhat complicated to the uninformed, so I’ll start us off with a brief summary. In 1989, the mayor of Oka approved the expansion of town development on to Kanesatake reserve. This land included a Mohawk burial ground and a sacred grove. Of course, this led to a backlash from the Mohawks. They set up barricades to stop the construction. The government sent increasingly dangerous threats. First, they sent the local police, then sent the RCMP when they couldn’t stop them. On August 20th, the situation escalated so much that the federal military had to take over the situation.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>News Reporter:</i> Thanks for the summary. Our field reporters say that the conflict seems to be coming to a close as we speak. Some of the Mohawk protesters seem to be burning their weapons and leaving the blockades, according to eye witness reports. The military and local police forces appear to be arresting and detaining some of the protestors who have left. Some citizens are concerned about the tactics being used by both sides of the conflict. What do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Special Guest:</i> Yes, arguments have certainly broken out about both sides of the conflict. On the one hand, the blockades are blocking traffic and are considered a nuisance by many citizens. However, others are saying that the Mohawks are justified in their ways. Reports say that the police forces had used tear gas against the Mohawks, and the land originally belongs to the Mohawks anyway, so what right does the city have to it? Also, a 14-year-old girl was stabbed with a bayonet by one of the soldiers. That was big news- no doubt you’ve already heard about it. 
<br/>
<br/>
<i>News Reporter:</i> Thank you for the insight. We can only hope the situation can resolve itself peacefully. Until next time, this has been Oka News. Thanks for listening.

This prompted Oka to call in the _Surete du Quebec_ (SQ) for the removal of the barricades. In the morning of July 11, however, the SQ launched a poorly planned raid that ended in confusion and the death of Constable Marcel Lemay. As the blockade continued, the provincial government called for the RCMP and shortly after the Canadian Armed Forces. Pressured by the army’s presence, many of the Mohawk warriors opted themselves out of the conflict.

The situation is reminiscent of a play called _Antigone_, both dealing with the extremes of the search for justice. In the play, the main character of the same name is not allowed to bury her brother for he brought a foreign army to take the city of Thebes. She then breaks the law and buries him. In the end, Antigone was imprisoned in a dirt mound, in where she hangs herself in a noose. Despite her tragic end, she remained determined for she vowed that she “will bury him” and that “if [she] die[s] in the act, [then] that death will be a glory.” That is like how the Mohawk Warriors are set on keeping their land, minus the suicide. Yet, even so, it is Antigone’s extreme and stubborn nature that the situation escalated so rapidly.

How far should people go in their pursuit of justice? When would the consequences outweigh the benefits? In Canada, the _Canadian Charter of Rights_ was developed over the century of the country’s existence. In it, it states that “If you are charged with an offense under federal or provincial law you also have the right to be presumed innocent until a proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal” (Canadian Charter of rights, 11d). This at least gives us the structure for a peaceful resolve. However, it is not a perfect system; mistrials are known to occur, the court system is not always reliable to help protect our rights on its own. And also, what if the law was different? That is why the _Charter_ also allows the freedom of assembly, which means a group of people can collectively express, promote, pursue, and defend their collective ideas and beliefs. 

A person should be able to pursue their idea of justice while ensuring that they cause the minimum amount of damage to others, whether physical, mental or emotional. We should not allow justice to be tainted by prejudice and emotions such as anger or sadness; this is what leads to lynch mobs, riots and even to some part terrorism. Instead, we should utilize the tools of democracy: fair representation in parliament, the court system and the freedom to be able to organize a protest to get our issues and concerns heard; that way, maybe we can finally strive for greater peace.
